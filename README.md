# DSA Roadmap

## Project Description
The DSA Roadmap project provides a comprehensive guide to learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in an organized manner. This roadmap is designed to help students and professionals in mastering DSA concepts, with a focus on preparing for coding interviews and improving problem-solving skills.

## Features
- **Structured Learning Path**: A step-by-step guide starting from basic concepts to advanced algorithms.
- **Interactive Resources**: Includes references to books, courses, and coding platforms for hands-on practice.
- **Problem Sets**: Curated lists of problems from various platforms (LeetCode, Codeforces, HackerRank) for each topic.
- **Topic Coverage**:
  - Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists
  - Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs
  - Sorting and Searching Algorithms
  - Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms
  - Graph Algorithms, Advanced Topics

## How to Use
1. Follow the roadmap sequentially, starting from the basics.
2. Practice problems and improve your understanding of each topic.
3. Refer to the linked resources for additional learning and hands-on experience.
4. Stay consistent with your practice to solidify your knowledge and skills.
