﻿

Pooja is a teacher who recently conducted two exams for her students, "Mathematics" and "Science." She is working on a program to merge the scores of both exams and identify the maximum score achieved by any student.


The program takes two arrays, mathScores, and scienceScores, as inputs. Each array represents the scores of the respective subjects for all the students. Pooja wants to combine the arrays and find the maximum score obtained by any student in both exams.


By merging the arrays, Pooja can have a comprehensive view of the student's performance across both subjects and identify the highest score achieved, which can be helpful for further analysis or recognizing outstanding performance.

Problem Statement


At a university, two student clubs, "Tech Wizards" and "Creative Minds," have decided to merge and form a new club called "Innovative Thinkers."


As part of the merger process, the club leaders, Alex and Sarah, need to create a program that merges the member lists of the two clubs and identifies the unique members in the merged list.


The program takes two arrays, arr1, and arr2, as inputs. Each array represents the member IDs of the respective clubs. Alex and Sarah want to combine the arrays and generate a single array, merged, containing all the unique member IDs.


To ensure a seamless merger, the program should eliminate any duplicate member IDs and only include unique IDs in the merged array. This way, they can maintain a consolidated member list without repetition.

Problem Statement


You are working on a mathematics application that requires merging two sorted lists of numbers into a single sorted list without any duplicates. Your task is to write a program that performs this merging operation on two lists of numbers.


Your program should merge the numbers from the first and second lists into a single sorted list, removing any duplicate numbers. The merged list should contain all the unique numbers, arranged in ascending order.


After merging the lists, your program should output the numbers in the merged list, according to the initial array.


Example


Input:

4

1 3 5 7

5

2 4 6 8 9


Output:

1 2 3 4

5 6 7 8 9


Explanation:

The first list has 4 numbers [1, 3, 5, 7], and the second list has 5 numbers [2, 4, 6, 8, 9]. After sorting, the list becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] with duplicates removed and sorted in ascending order. After merging, the first list becomes [1, 2, 3, 4] and the second list becomes [5, 6, 7, 8, 9].


Note: This is a sample question asked in HCL recruitment.
Input format :

The second line of input consists of n elements inside the first array.

The third line of input consists of the size of the array m.

The fourth line of input consists of m elements inside the second array.
Output format :

After sorting the array, the first line of output prints the first n sorted numbers, and the second line prints the last m numbers.

Pooja is an aspiring chef who loves experimenting with different recipes. She is currently working on a program that merges two arrays representing ingredients and prints the minimum ingredient required in the resulting array.



Pooja often combines different ingredients from multiple recipes to create unique dishes. To keep track of the ingredients, she has created two arrays, arr1, and arr2, where each element represents a specific ingredient, and the value indicates the quantity required.



To streamline her cooking process, Pooja wants to create a program that merges the two ingredient arrays and identifies the minimum ingredient required in the resulting array. By knowing the minimum ingredient, Pooja can ensure that she has enough of that ingredient on hand for her culinary experiments.
